Q1.-> Python can be used for various purposes from backend development to building data pipelines and cloud computing, it is very easy to use and can be used on multiple platform using PVM python virtual machine hence its called a general purpose high-level programing language.

Q2.-> Unlike other languages we do not need to declare data-type for the value before compilation, python stores that value at some memory location and then binds that variable name to that memory container which makes the contents of the container accessible through that variable name and the data-type is only known at runtime, hence python is called a dynamically typed language.

Q3.-> Advantages of Python
	1. Easy to use.
	2. Interpreted Language.
	3. Dynamically Typed.
	4. Multi-platform/ portable.
      Disadvantages of Python
	1. Slower Speed than Other Languages.
	2. Not Memory Efficient.
	3. Pythonâ€™s database access layer.
	4. Runtime Errors.

Q4.->	1. Web development.
	2. Data science.
	3. OS development.
	4. Scientific programming.
	5. Game Development.

Q5.-> A variable is a reserved memory location to store values.we can declare a variable a as a=100 in python.

Q6.-> To take input in python we use the built-in input() function.

Q7.-> By default the input value is in string datatype.

Q8.-> Converting one datatype into another is known as type casting.

Q9.-> We cannot multiple individual inputs from one input function, however we can use the split() function in python to divide the input from same line into multiple values.

Q10.-> Python keywords are special reserved words that have specific meanings and purposes and can't be used for anything but those specific purposes.

Q11.-> No, keywords are special words that have specific purposes and can't be used as variables as they will be recognized by a keyword to execute that specific purpose.

Q12.-> Python indentation refers to adding white space before a statement to a particular block of code. In another word, all the statements with the same space to the right, belong to the same code block.

Q13.-> In python we output using the print statement.

Q14.-> Operators are special symbols that designate that some sort of computation should be performed.

Q34. Python list are dynamically sized array, declared in languages like C++ and Java. A list is a collection of things, enclosed in [ ] and separated by commas. 

Q35.  You can create a list by opening and closing the square brackets [].

Q36. We can access the elements in a list by indexing.

Q37.

print(lst[4][2])


Q38.

print(len(n))

Q39. 
lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]

Q40. Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list. The sequence of values stored in a tuple can be of any type, and they are indexed by integers. 
Tuples are immutable where as list are mutable. We can also faster through the tuples than the list.

Q41.We can create tuple using round brackets ().

Q42. No, I can't as tuples are immutable. The work around is it typecast tuple to list and then append.

tup = ()
tup = list(tup)
tup.append("Vishal")
tup = tuple(tup)
tup

Q43. Yes, we can.

tup1 = ("Vishal ")
tup2 = ("Singh")
tup1+tup2

Q44. 
x = input("Enter the values separeted by space: ").split(" ")
x = tuple(x)
print(len(x))

Q45. A set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, mutable and has no duplicate elements. The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements.

Q46. We can create set using curly brackets {}. Keep in mind empty {} will result in dictionary hence there must be some value in the brackets.

Q47. 
set1 = {"iNeuron"}
set1

Q48. 
set1.add("Big")
set1.add("Data")
set1


Q49. We can add more than one element in a single go using update(), but using add() it's not possible.

Q50. To remove all the elements from the set, clear() function is used.

Q51. Frozen sets in Python are immutable objects that only support methods and operators that produce a result without affecting the frozen set or sets to which they are applied. While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation. 

Q52. 
- Frozen sets are immutable where as sets are mutable.
- Sets can't be used as keys in dictionary where as frozen sets can be used.

Q53.  Python set Union() Method returns a new set which contains all the items from the original set.

set1 = {2, 4, 5, 6}
set2 = {4, 6, 7, 8}
set3 = {7, 8, 9, 10}
print("set1 U set2 : ", set1 | set2)
print("set1 U set2 U set3 :", set1 |set2 | set3)

Q54. Python set intersection() method returns a new set with an element that is common to all set

set1 = {2, 4, 5, 6}
set2 = {4, 6, 7, 8}
set3 = {4, 6, 8}

print("set1 intersection set2 : ", set1.intersection(set2))

print("set1 intersection set2 intersection set3 :", set1.intersection(set2, set3))


Q55. Dictionary in Python is a collection of keys values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other data types which hold only a single value as an element.

Q56. Dictionary is having key and value pair where as all other data structures have only values in them.

Q57. We can create dictionary using curly brackets {}.

Q58. type = dict

Q59. 
Dict = {}
Dict[0] = "Hello"
Dict[1] = "Course: ["Data Science", "Big Data"]"


Q60.
Dict = {"Name": "Vishal", "Experience": 3, "Organisation":"iNeuron"}
for i, j in Dict.items():
  print(f"Key is {i} and value is {j}")


Q61. 
Dict = {"Name": {"f_name":"Vishal", "l_name":"Singh"}, "Experience": 3, "Organisation":"iNeuron"}
for i, j in Dict["Name"].items():
  print(f"Key is {i} and value is {j}")

Q62. get() is also to access the elements in dictionary.

Dict = {"Name": "Vishal", "Experience": 3, "Organisation":"iNeuron"}
print(Dict.get("Name"))

Q63. items() method is used to return the list with all dictionary keys with values.

Dict = {"Name": "Vishal", "Experience": 3, "Organisation":"iNeuron"}
print(Dict.items())

Q64. 
Dict = {"Name": "Vishal", "Experience": 3, "Organisation":"iNeuron"}
print(Dict.pop("Name"))

Q65. popitem() method removes the last inserted key-value pair from the dictionary and returns it as a tuple.

Dict = {"Name": "Vishal", "Experience": 3, "Organisation":"iNeuron"}
print(Dict.popitem())

Q66. keys() method returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys in the dictionary.

Dict = {"Name": "Vishal", "Experience": 3, "Organisation":"iNeuron"}
print(Dict.keys())

Q67. values() is an inbuilt method in Python programming language that returns a view object. The view object contains the values of the dictionary, as a list.

Dict = {"Name": "Vishal", "Experience": 3, "Organisation":"iNeuron"}
print(Dict.values())

Q68.Loops are used the iterate over a block of statement multiple times.

Q69.There is for and while loop in Python

Q70. When we know the exact number of iterations, we can use for loop. When we want the to run till a certain condition is true we can use while loop.

Q71. Continue Statement skips the execution of the program block from after the continue statement and forces the control to start the next iteration.

Q72. break statement in Python is used to bring the control out of the loop when some external condition is triggered. break statement is put inside the loop body

Q73. The pass statement is a null statement. But the difference between pass and comment is that comment is ignored by the interpreter whereas pass is not ignored. 

Q74. range() function returns a sequence of numbers, in a given range. The most common use of it is to iterate sequence on a sequence of numbers
